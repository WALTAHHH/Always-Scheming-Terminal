## Notes for AST Implementation

- **Aliases matter:** EA = Electronic Arts, T2 = Take-Two, SIE = Sony Interactive, ABK = Activision Blizzard, MSFT Gaming = Microsoft Gaming
- **Subsidiaries should tag parent too:** Riot → also tag Tencent. Bungie → also tag Sony. Bethesda → also tag Microsoft.
- **Public companies are highest priority** — these appear in earnings, M&A, and investor news most frequently
- **This list is living** — add companies as they appear in articles, remove if they never come up
